What are the general scnerios for all the collection items?
i. addition, deletion, updation,creation
ii. Sorting
iii. Searching
iv. Custom objects handlling
v. too much data processing
vi. sending data over internet
vii. Explain the internal implementation of ArrayList. How does it dynamically resize, and what are the performance implications of this resizing?
viii. Compare and contrast the performance of ArrayList and LinkedList for various operations (add, remove, get, iterate). When would you choose one over the other, and why?"
ix. Discuss the time complexity of ArrayList.contains() and ArrayList.indexOf(). How could you optimize these operations for large lists?
x. How does the ArrayList handle concurrent modifications? What are the potential issues, and how can they be mitigated?
xi. Write a method that efficiently removes duplicate elements from an ArrayList while preserving the original order. Discuss the time and space complexity of your solution."
Explain the concept of ArrayList.subList(). What are the potential pitfalls of using it, and how can they be avoided?
How would you create a thread-safe version of an ArrayList? Discuss different approaches and their trade-offs.
Given an ArrayList of custom objects, how would you implement a custom sorting algorithm that is more efficient than Collections.sort() for specific scenarios?
How does the garbage collector handle the elements inside an ArrayList? What are potential memory leaks related to ArrayLists?
Explain the benefits of using generics with ArrayList. How does it improve type safety and code readability?
Discuss the concept of type erasure in Java generics. How does it affect the runtime behavior of ArrayList?
How can you create an ArrayList that can hold elements of different types while maintaining some level of type safety?
Imagine you have a large dataset that needs to be processed in real-time. How would you use ArrayList in conjunction with other data structures and algorithms to efficiently handle this data?
You are given a very large ArrayList, and you need to find the K most frequent elements. How would you approach this problem?
In a system that receives a constant stream of data, how would you use ArrayList to maintain a sliding window of the last N elements and perform calculations on it?
